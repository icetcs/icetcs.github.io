DNA computing is emerging as a versatile technology that promises a
vast range of applications, including biosensing, drug delivery and
synthetic biology. DNA logic circuits can be achieved in solution
using strand displacement reactions, or by decision-making molecular
robots-so called 'walkers'-that traverse tracks placed on DNA
'origami' tiles.

Similarly to conventional silicon technologies, ensuring fault-free
DNA circuit designs is challenging, with the difficulty compounded by
the inherent unreliability of the DNA technology and lack of
scientific understanding. This lecture will give an overview of
computational models that capture DNA walker computation and
demonstrate the role of quantitative verification and synthesis in
ensuring the reliability of such systems. Future research challenges
will also be discussed.
