       Techniques and Tools for the Analysis of Timed Workflows

Analysis of workflow processes with quantitative aspects like timing
is of interest in numerous time-critical applications.  In this talk,
I will suggest a workflow model based on timed-arc Petri nets and
study the foundational problems of soundness and strong (time-bounded)
soundness. We will explore the decidability of these problems and
show, among others, that soundness is decidable for monotonic workflow
nets while reachability is undecidable. For general timed-arc workflow
nets soundness and strong soundness become undecidable, though we can
design efficient verification algorithms for the practically
interesting subclass of bounded nets. Finally, I demonstrate the
usability of the theory on a few case studies of a Brake System
Control Unit used in aircraft certification, the MPEG2 encoding
algorithm, a blood transfusion workflow and a home automation system
for a family house. The implementation of the algorithms is freely
available as a part of the model checker TAPAAL
(www.tapaal.net<http://www.tapaal.net>).
