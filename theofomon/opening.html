<h1 align=center><b>Theoretical Foundations for Monitorability</b> <br>
<b>School of Computer Science, Reykjavik University</b><br>
<b>One PhD or Postdoctoral Position</b></h1>

Applications are invited for one PhD or postdoctoral position at the
School of Computer Science, Reykjavik University.  The position is
part of a research project funded by the Icelandic Research Fund,
under the direction of Luca Aceto (Reykjavik University), Adrian
Francalanza (University of Malta) and Anna Ingolfsdottir (Reykjavik
University). The general aim of the project is to develop further the
theoretical foundations of monitorability for fragments of variants of
Hennessy-Milner logic with recursion/modal mu-calculus.

<br></br>
The project work will build on the
<a href=(http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-23820-3_5>RV 2015
paper</a> by the co-proposers, and on the experience developed during
their previous work on runtime verification and on the tool
<a href=http://www.cs.um.edu.mt/svrg/Tools/detectEr/>detectEr</a>. The
goals of the project will be:

<UL>
<LI>    to explore more stringent conditions for detection than the ones considered in the RV 2015 paper and study whether this has any effect on the monitorable subset of the logic; </LI>
<LI>    to investigate the monitorability of the logic with respect
    to instrumentation set-ups other than the one used in the RV 2015 paper; </LI>
<LI>    to extend our results from the RV 2015 paper to the setting of real-time systems, modelled as timed automata, and to a real-time variant of Hennessy-Milner Logic with recursion;
</LI>
<LI>    to understand how existing notions of monitorability relate to the one formulated in the RV 2015 paper, thereby consolidating disparate concepts of monitorability;
</LI>
<LI>    to investigate extensions to monitorability that incorporate notions
    of enforceability; and </LI>
<LI>    to apply the results of the theoretical work in the construction of a prototype software tool for the runtime analysis of systems. </LI>
</UL>

The successful candidate will benefit from, and contribute to, the
research environment at the <a href=http://www.icetcs.ru.is/>Icelandic
Centre of Excellence in Theoretical Computer Science (ICE-TCS)</a>. .
<br></br>
Moreover, she/he will visit Adrian Francalanza's group at the University of Malta during the project work and will benefit from the research experience on runtime verification within that group.

<h2>Qualification requirements</h2>

Applicants for the PhD fellowship should have an MSc degree in
Computer Science, or closely related fields. Some background in
concurrency theory and mathematical competence are desirable. <br></br>

Applicants for the postdoctoral position should have, or be about to hold, a PhD degree in Computer Science or closely related fields. Previous knowledge of at least one of concurrency theory, process calculi, (structural) operational semantics and logic in computer science is highly desirable. 

<h2>Remuneration</h2>

The PhD position provides a stipend of 290,000 ISK (roughly 2080 € at the current exchange rate) per month before taxes, for three years, starting as early as possible. <br></br>
 
The wage for the postdoctoral position is 400,000 ISK (roughly 2870  € at the present exchange rate) per month before taxes. The position is for one year, starting on September 1, 2016 (later starting dates are possible), and is renewable for another year, based on good performance and mutual satisfaction.

<h2>Application details</h2>

Interested applicants should send their CV, including a list of publications, in PDF to all addresses below, together with a statement outlining their suitability for the project and the names of at least two referees.

<ul>
