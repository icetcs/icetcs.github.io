<title>NWPT 2021: Travel information</title>

</head>

<body>

  <h2>Weather</h2>

  <p>The place to check
  is <a href="https://en.vedur.is/">vedur.is</a>, the website of
  Iceland's Met Office. You will find the weather forecast and
  observations (including aurora) as well as earthquake observations
  etc.</p>

  
  <h2>Entry restrictions due to Covid</h2>


  <p>Check <a href="https://covid.is/english">covid.is</a> for the current
  Covid situation in Iceland.</p>

  <p>To participate in the workshop (without quarantining first) you
  need a vaccination or recovery certificate. In addition, you must
  present a negative PCR or rapid antigen test result from home (not
  older than 72 hours) and preregister
  online. Check <a href="https://island.is/en/p/entry">island.is</a>.</p>
  


  <h2>Accommodation</h2>

<p>Accommodation is generally expensive in Greater Reykjavik and
  Iceland in general and not necessarily of the best quality for what you pay. It is something that you simply have to put up with. Use <a href="https://www.booking.com/">booking.com</a>
  or <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">airbnb</a>, read reviews, and
  choose the location carefully.</p>

<p>Public buses are infrequent and expensive. So even if your hotel is
not very far, if it is not walking distance from the university, you
  may be in mild trouble. (Notice that you need Reykjavik University, not the University of Iceland; both are located next to the domestic airport,
but at opposite ends).</p>

<p>In general, any location in Reykjavik districts 101 (102) is fine
  and 105 and 107 too. (Residents of Greater Reykjavik tend to
  identify city districts by postal codes.)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.icelandairhotels.com/en/hotels/reykjavik/reykjavik-natura">Hotel
  Natura</a> is between the center and the university, also very close
  to the terminals of Reykjavik Excursions at BSÍ and AirportDirect at
  Skógarhlíð.</p>


  <h2>Money</h2>

<p>No-one uses cash in Iceland. We recommend that you do not exchange
currency or withdraw Icelandic cash from an ATM.</p>


<h2>Getting from the airport to Reykjavik</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.isavia.is/en/keflavik-airport">Keflavík
  international airport (KEF)</a> is next to the town of Reykjanesbær
  some 50 kms from Reykjavik.</p>

<p>You get to the city with one of the two commercial operators
<a href="https://www.re.is/">Reykjavik Excursions</a>
and <a href="https://www.airportdirect.is">AirportDirect</a>. The
transfer costs about 3500 ISK one way. If you add a connection to your
hotel/guesthouse, that is another 1000 ISK. The operators are
comparable, but Reykjavik Excursions does not publish their schedule,
ask when the bus goes before you buy the ticket. There are ticket
booths in the arrivals hall and buses depart straight in front of the
entrance door. There is no need to book the ticket in advance on the
way to Reykjavik. (On the way back to the airport you might want an
advance booking, including a pickup from your accommodation.)</p>

<p>There is also the line 55 of the Icelandic public bus
system <a href="https://www.straeto.is/en">Strætó</a>. The ride costs
1960 ISK one way. The bus stop is a bit hidden next to the airport
hotel. This bus is infrequent, but you can check the
  schedules.</p>

<p>Unless you are Norwegian, you do not want to think of taking a taxi
  from/to the airport.</p>


<h2>Getting around in Reykjavik</h2>

<p>The center is small. For places a bit further, you may need to use
    buses of <a href="https://www.straeto.is/en">Strætó</a>. A single
    ticket costs 490 ISK, it is valid for changes in the Greater
    Reykjavik area during 75 mins. For buying a ticket, the easiest is
    the Strætó app (if you get it to work with your credit
    card). Otherwise, you can buy paper tickets at any 10-11
    convenience store or any public swimming pool. The paper ticket
    has to be dropped in a box by the driver. If you need to
    change to another bus, you have to ask the driver to give you a
    "transfer ticket".</p>

<p>Nearly all bus stops were renamed some months ago. You see both old
  and new stop names in use, which can be very confusing.</p>

<p>From the center to the university you can get with bus 8 from Gamla
  Hringbraut (formerly, BSÍ) to HR (formerly, Nauthóll - HR).  This is
  just 2 stops, but it is a walk of 20 mins along the perimeter of the
  domestic airport. To Gamla Hringbraut, you have to walk or take some
  other bus (1, 3, 5, 6, 15), depending on where you are staying.

<p>In evenings and on weekends, one gets to/from HR with bus 5
  instead. This route starts in a far-out suburb in the East of
  Reyjavik, stops at Ártún (a major stop for changing between lines),
  passes through Laugardalur, stops at Hlemmur (the main hub for
  Reykjavik's city buses) and Gamla Hringbraut.</p>


<h2>Eating out and foodstores</h2>

  <p>Eating out is expensive, but nicer restaurants are nice, no
  doubt.</p>

  <p>The useful foodstore chains are Bónus, Krónan and Nettó.  Opening
   times vary, some stores open later and close earlier than you would
   expect. At 10-11 and Krambúð stores (open long or round the clock)
   you will find a limited selection and high prices.</p>
  
<h2>Swimming pools</h2>

<p>The best and also the cheapest fun in Reykjavik are
the <a href="https://reykjavik.is/en/all-swimming-pools">geothermal
swimming pools</a>. The main ones in the city are Laugardalslaug,
Sundhöll Reykjavíkur and Vesturbæjarlaug. You get an outdoor swimming
pool (25 m in most places, 50 m in Laugardalslaug; the water
temperature is 26 C all year round), hotpots (38-42 C) and steam
saunas. Sundhöll Reykjavíkur is the most central one, but has an odd
system of locking lockers (you have to bring your own padlock, which
won't fit, or buy one). Laugardalslaug (with a much more reasonable
locker system) is the biggest and most fun. A single ticket costs 1060
ISK.</p>

<p>All swimming pools are open from early morning until 22.00 and this
means you can stay in the pool until 22.00 and then have 15 extra
minutes to change and rush out.</p>
  
<p>Just next to Reykjavik University, there is
the <a href="https://nautholsvik.is/en/">Nauthólsvík geothermal
beach</a>. Here the fun consists in a hotpot and dips in the ocean
(seawater ~5 C), there is also a steam sauna. This place is open 11-19
daily, until 16 on Sat, closed Sun. A single ticket is 710 ISK.</p>

<p>There is also the <a href="https://www.bluelagoon.com/">Blue
Lagoon</a> if you want to pay a lot more. It is closer to the airport
than to Greater Reykjavik and you will need a whole morning or
afternoon to go there. There is also
the <a href="https://www.skylagoon.com/">brand new spa</a> in
Kópavogur.</p>

<p>If you are into this type of thing, take your swimming gear with
  you!</p>

<h2>The volcano trip</h2>

<p>We plan to take you to the Geldingadalir (Fagradalsfjall) volcano
that started erupting 19 March 2021 and was very busy producing
spectacular lava fountains and rivers for months but has now been
quiet for 5 weeks.</p>

<p>Because of wind and cold, you need warm wind- and waterproof
clothing, including a cap, a scarf and gloves, and above all good
hiking boots since the terrain is not particularly difficult, but very
uneven, so you may inadvertently damage your ancle. The trail can also
be slippery and muddy.</p>

<p>Here is
<a href="https://www.visitreykjanes.is/en/volcano-eruption/eruption-information">eruption
information</a> from the municipality. Here is
the <a href="https://safetravel.is/eruption-in-reykjanes">advisory</a>
(updated daily) by Search and Rescue.  The full walk (trail C) is
3-4 kms one way depending on the starting point; we may not be
able to go all the way.</p>
