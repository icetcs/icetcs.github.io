But it does not present an attractive mathematical ontology: it seems daft to say that every mathematical object is ``really'' some (pure) set. My goal, in this paper, is to explain how we can inhabit the set-theorist's paradise of \emph{mathematical objects} whilst remaining \emph{ontologically neutral}. I start by considering stories with this shape: (1) Gizmos are found in stages; every gizmo is found at some stage. (2) Each gizmo reifies (some fixed number of) relations (or functions) which are defined only over earlier-found gizmos. (3) Every gizmo has (exactly one) colour; same-coloured  gizmos reify relations in the same way; same-coloured gizmos are identical iff they reify the same relations.Such a story can be told about (iterative) sets: they are monochromatic gizmos which reify one-place properties. But we can also tell such stories about gizmos other than sets. By tidying up the general idea of such stories, I arrive at the notion of a MOON theory (for Mathematical Objects with Ontological Neutrality). With weak assumptions, I obtain a metatheorem: \emph{all MOON theories are synonymous}. Consequently, they are (all) synonymous with a theory which articulates the iterative notion of set (LT$_+$; see \cite{Button:LT1}). So: all MOON theories (can) deliver the set-theorist's paradise of mathematical objects. But, since different MOON theories have different (apparent) ontologies, we attain ontological neutrality. My metatheorem generalizes some of my work on Level Theory (\cite{Button:LT1}, \cite{Button:LT2}, \cite{Button:LT3}). It also delivers a partial realization of Conway's ``Mathematician's Liberation Movement'' \cite[p.66]{Conway:ONG}. \begin{thebibliography}{10}\bibitem{Button:LT1}Button, T.
