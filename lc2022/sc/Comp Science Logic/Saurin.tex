I will survey several topics, notably the global validity condition, the productivity of cut-elimination, the impact of a careful treatment of structural rules, the question of proof invariants and the sequentiality of inferences.%In this talk, I'll explain how by relaxing wellfoundedness assumption on formal proofs, one can design well-behaved proof systems expressing  inductive and coinductive properties. One shall also%In this seminar, I will consider proof systems for logics expressing inductive and coinductive properties, focusing on "circular" and non-wellfounded proofs. Those derivations are finitely branching but admit infinitely deep branches, possibly subject to some regularity conditions. Circular derivations are closely related with "proofs by infinite descent" and shall be equipped with a global condition preventing vicious circles in proofs.%After surveying several logics expressing (co)inductive properties and circular proofs,%I will concentrate on the mu-calculus in a linear setting, that is, on linear logic extended with least and greatest fixed points.\begin{thebibliography}{10}%% INSERT YOUR BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES HERE; %% SEE (4) BELOW FOR PROPER FORMAT.%% EACH ENTRY MUST BEGIN WITH \bibitem{citation key}%%%% IF THERE ARE NO ENTRIES  %% DELETE THE LINE ABOVE (\begin{thebibliography}{20}) %% AND THE LINE BELOW (\end{thebibliography})%%% For a Journal article%% %David Baelde. 2012.
