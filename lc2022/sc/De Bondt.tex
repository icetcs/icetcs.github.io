In fact, we can consider a notion of strong semiproperness, in analogy to the notion of strong properness and verify that $\mathbb{P}$ satisfies it, again with respect to these distinguished models.As an application of this approach towards Namba forcing, we discuss a particularly natural presentation of an ``ersatz iterated Namba forcing'' which, given an increasing sequence $(\kappa_\alpha : \alpha < \gamma)$ of regular cardinals $\geq \omega_2,$ adds for every $\alpha < \gamma$ a countable cofinal subset of $\kappa_\alpha$, while at the same time preserving stationarity of stationary subsets of~$\omega_1.$ In the proof, we will make strong use of a technique involving labelled trees and games played on such trees that appears in \cite{cite1}.Finally, we will mention closely related ongoing work and remaining questions.\\This talk is based on joint work with my thesis supervisor Boban Veli\v{c}kovi\'c.\begin{thebibliography}{10}\bibitem{cite1} {\scshape Matthew Foreman and Menachem Magidor},{\itshape Mutually stationary sequences of sets and the non-saturation of the non-stationary ideal on $P_\kappa(\lambda)$},{\bfseries\itshape Acta Mathematica},vol.~186 (2001), no.~2, pp.~271--300.\bibitem{cite2}{\scshape Saharon Shelah},{\bfseries\itshape Proper and Improper Forcing},Perspectives in Logic, vol.~5,Cambridge University Press,1998.\end{thebibliography}\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}\end{document}
