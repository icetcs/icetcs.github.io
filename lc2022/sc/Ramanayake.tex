%% INSERT TEXT OF ABSTRACT DIRECTLY BELOW

The primary motivation for cut-elimination is that it leads to a proof calculus with the subformula property. Such a proof calculus has a restricted proof search space and this is a powerful aid for investigating the properties of the logic. Unfortunately, many substructural and modal logics of interest lack a sequent calculus that supports cut-elimination. The overwhelming response since the 1960s has been to generalise the sequent calculus in a bid to regain cut-elimination. The price is that these generalised formalisms are more complicated to reason about and implement.

There is an alternative: remain with the sequent calculus by accepting weaker (but still meaningful) versions of the subformula property. We will discuss how cut-free hypersequent proofs can be transformed into sequent calculus proofs in a controlled way~\cite{CiaLanRam21}. Combined with the quite general methodology~\cite{CiaGalTer08} for transforming Hilbert axiomatic extensions into cut-free hypersequent calculi, this leads to an algorithm taking a Hilbert axiomatic extension to a sequent calculus with a weak subformula property. 

Can we avoid this detour through the hypersequent calculus? This goes to the heart of a new programme called \textit{cut-restriction} that aims to adapt Gentzenâ€™s celebrated cut-elimination argument systematically so that cut-formulas are restricted (when elimination is not possible). We will present the early results in this programme: from arbitrary cuts  to analytic cuts in the sequent calculi for bi-intuitionistic logic and $S5$ via a uniform cut-restriction argument (the results themselves are well-known).

Based on joint work with Agata Ciabattoni (TU Wien) and Timo Lang (UCL).
