Such results include explicit strongly exponential lower bounds on monotone formula complexity, separations between the $\mAC^i$ and the $\mNC^i$ hierarchies, new techniques for proving lower bounds on the size of monotone circuits and of cutting planes proofs, exponential lower bounds on the size of cutting planes proofs for random CNF formulas, the resolution of the Alon-Saks-Seymour problem, and many others.This talk will focus on characterizations of proofs and circuits using the theory of total search problems (TFNP), expanding on classical results in complexity theory such as the characterization of circuit depth by Karchmer-Wigderson games, and the equivalence between tree-like Resolution and decision trees.We will also discuss how \emph{lifting theorems} and \emph{feasible interpolation} provide a connection between the query and communication complexity of certain search problems, and how this perspective suggests a whole program for further research.%\begin{thebibliography}{10}%% INSERT YOUR BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES HERE; %% SEE (4) BELOW FOR PROPER FORMAT.%% EACH ENTRY MUST BEGIN WITH \bibitem{citation key}%%%% IF THERE ARE NO ENTRIES  %% DELETE THE LINE ABOVE (\begin{thebibliography}{20}) %% AND THE LINE BELOW (\end{thebibliography})%\end{thebibliography}\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}% this space adjustment is usually necessary after a bibliography\end{document}%% READ ME%% READ ME%% READ MEINSTRUCTIONS FOR SUPPLYING INFORMATION IN THE CORRECT FORMAT: 1.
