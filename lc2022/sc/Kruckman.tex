%% INSERT TEXT OF ABSTRACT DIRECTLY BELOW

One of the most important technical steps in the development of simplicity theory in the 1990s was a result now known as Kim's Lemma: In a simple theory, if a formula $\varphi(x;b)$ divides over a model $M$, then $\varphi(x;b)$ divides along every Morley sequence in $\mathrm{tp}(b/M)$. More recently, variants of Kim's Lemma have been shown by Chernikov, Kaplan, and Ramsey to follow from, and in fact characterize, two generalizations of simplicity in different directions: the combinatorial dividing lines $\mathrm{NTP}_2$ and $\mathrm{NSOP}_1$. After surveying the Kim's Lemmas of the past, I will suggest a new variant of Kim's Lemma, and a corresponding new model-theoretic tree property, which generalizes both $\mathrm{TP}_2$ and $\mathrm{SOP}_1$. I will also compare this new tree property with the Antichain Tree Property ($\mathrm{ATP}$), another tree property generalizing both $\mathrm{TP}_2$ and $\mathrm{SOP}_1$, which was introduced recently by Ahn and Kim. This is joint work with Nick Ramsey.
