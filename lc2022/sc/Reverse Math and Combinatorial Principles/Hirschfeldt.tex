University Ave., Chicago, IL 60637, USA}\meetemail{drh@uchicago.edu}Mycielski's Theorem is a Ramsey-theoretic result on the reals withversions for measure and for category. These imply respectively thatthere is a perfect tree whose paths are all relatively $1$-random, andthat there is a perfect tree whose paths are all relatively$1$-generic. In fact, in relativized form, the latter two statementsare equivalent to the two versions of Mycielski's Theorem. I willdiscuss joint work with Carl G. Jockusch, Jr. and Paul E. Schupp onthe computability-theoretic and reverse-mathematical strength of thesestatements.\end{document}
