%% INSERT TEXT OF ABSTRACT DIRECTLY BELOW
The Elekes-Szab\'{o} problem asks when a complex variety $V\subseteq \prod_{i=1}^{3}W_i$ has unexpected large intersections with Cartesian products of finite subsets $X_i\subseteq W_i$ for $1\leq i\leq 3$. Under the assumption that $X_i$'s are in \emph{general position},  Elekes and Szab\'{o} proved that one can always find commutative algebraic groups in this scenario. 
%We would like to explore what happens if one weakens the general position assumption. 
We explored the case when $W_i$'s are a fixed cubic surface $S$ in $\mathbb{P}^3(\mathbb{C})$ and $V$ is the collinearity relation with the assumption that $X_i$ does not concentrate on any one-dimensional subvarieties of $S$, which substantially weakens the general position assumption. We proved that when $S$ is a smooth quadric surface union a plane, then one cannot find such $X_i$'s. When $S$ is an irreducible smooth cubic surface, then $X_i$'s would contain a union of translates of arithmetic progressions on the family of planar cubic curves of $S$. But the existence of such $X_i$'s is still open. This is a work-in-progress joint with Martin Bays and Jan Dobrowolski.
