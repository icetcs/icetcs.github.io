We will discuss how monadic NIP manifests in the theory $T$ itself rather than just in unary expansions, and how this can be used to produce structure or non-structure in hereditary classes. Analogous results concerning monadic stability may also be discussed.\begin{thebibliography}{10}%% INSERT YOUR BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES HERE; %% SEE (4) BELOW FOR PROPER FORMAT.%% EACH ENTRY MUST BEGIN WITH \bibitem{citation key}%%%% IF THERE ARE NO ENTRIES  %% DELETE THE LINE ABOVE (\begin{thebibliography}{20}) %% AND THE LINE BELOW (\end{thebibliography})\bibitem{cite1}{\scshape Samuel Braunfeld and Michael C.
