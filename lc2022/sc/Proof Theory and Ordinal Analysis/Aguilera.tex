%% INSERT TEXT OF ABSTRACT DIRECTLY BELOW

The $\Pi^1_2$-soundness ordinal of a theory $T$, denoted $o^1_2(T)$, is a measure of how close $T$ is to being $\Pi^1_2$-correct. The $\Pi^1_2$-spectrum conjecture 
asserts that the possible values of $o^1_2(T)$ for recursively enumerable extensions of $\mathsf{ACA}_0$ are precisely the $\Sigma^1_1$-definable epsilon 
numbers. In this talk, we present a proof of the following theorem, which is formalizable in weak set theories: If the $\Pi^1_2$-Spectrum Conjecture 
fails, then Second-Order Arithmetic is consistent. This is joint work with Fedor Pakhomov.
