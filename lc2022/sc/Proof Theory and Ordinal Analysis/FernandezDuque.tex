%% INSERT TEXT OF ABSTRACT DIRECTLY BELOW


Noetherian Gödel logics are many-valued logics where the set of truth values is a closed subset of $[0,1]$ without infinite ascending sequences.
These logics are parametrized by countable ordinals, so that ${\sf G}^\downarrow_\alpha$ is the logic with truth values inversely isomorphic to $\alpha+1$.
In this talk we discuss the complexity of satisfiability and validity for each Noetherian Gödel logic, strengthening and generalizing results of Baaz-Leitsch-Zach and Hájek.
Specifically, we show that the complexity of satisfiability and validity in ${\sf G}^\downarrow_\alpha$ are related to $\Sigma^1_1$ and $\Pi^1_1$ formulas, respectively, over $(\mathbb L_\beta)_{\beta\leq\alpha}$.

This is joint work with Juan P. Aguilera and Jan Bydzovsky
