%% INSERT TEXT OF ABSTRACT DIRECTLY BELOW

Positive logic is a very flexible framework unifying full first-order logic with several other settings, such as Robinson's logic (which studies existentially closed models of a possibly non-companionable first-order universal theory), hyperimaginary extensions of first-order theories (which are obtained by adding quotients by type-definable equivalence relations), and, in certain aspects, continuous logic.

The study of tameness in those contexts goes back to A. Pillay's work on simple Robinson's theories (\cite{Pi}), and I. Ben Yaacov's work on simple compact abstract theories (\cite{BY}). In the talk, I will present a joint work with M. Kamsma on NSOP$_1$ in positive logic and a joint work in progress with R. Mennuni on NIP in positive logic, discussing in particular the main motivating examples for the two projects: existentially closed exponential fields (studied before by L. Haykazyan and J. Kirby in \cite{HK}) and existentially closed ordered abelian groups with an automorphism.
