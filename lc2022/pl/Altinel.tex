%% INSERT TEXT OF ABSTRACT DIRECTLY BELOW
Ever since the work of Borovik and Cherlin on permutation groups of finite Morley rank (\cite{BoCh08}), there has been growing
interest in faithful actions finite groups on various types of groups of finite Morley rank. This interest is due to various
motivations: classifying highly generically transitive actions on sets (\cite{AW}), highly generically transitive representations (\cite{}), 
definable actions of finite groups on groups of finite Morley rank, automorphisms of groups of finite Morley rank. In my talk,
I will give an overview of these lines of research and detail a recent result joint with Joshua Wiscons on lower bounds in the
case of faithful actions of the alternating group on a nonsolvable group of finite Morley rank that does not contain involutions.
