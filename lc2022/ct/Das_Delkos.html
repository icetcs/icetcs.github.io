<p>We investigate the proof complexity of systems based on positive branching programs, i.e. non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs) where, for any 0-transition between two nodes, there is also a 1-transition. Positive NBPs compute monotone Boolean functions, like negation-free circuits or formulas, but constitute a positive version of (non-uniform) <strong>NL</strong>, rather than <strong>P</strong> or <span class="math inline"><strong>NC</strong><sup>1</sup></span>, respectively.</p>
<p>The proof complexity of NBPs was investigated in previous work by Buss, Das and Knop, using extension variables to represent the dag-structure, over a language of (non-deterministic) decision trees, yielding the system <span class="math inline">eLNDT</span>. Our system <span class="math inline">eLNDT<sup>+</sup></span> is obtained by restricting their systems to a positive syntax, similarly to how the ‘monotone sequent calculus’ <span class="math inline">MLK</span> is obtained from the usual sequent calculus <span class="math inline">LK</span> by restricting to negation-free formulas.</p>
<p>Our main result is that <span class="math inline">eLNDT<sup>+</sup></span> polynomially simulates <span class="math inline">eLNDT</span> over positive sequents. Our proof method is inspired by a similar result for <span class="math inline">MLK</span> by Atserias, Galesi and Pudlák, that was recently improved to a bona fide polynomial simulation via works of Jeřábek and Buss, Kabanets, Kolokolova and Koucký. Along the way we formalise several properties of counting functions within <span class="math inline">eLNDT<sup>+</sup></span> by polynomial-size proofs and, as a case study, give explicit polynomial-size poofs of the propositional pigeonhole principle.</p>
