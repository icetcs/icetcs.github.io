<p>We investigate a non-classical version of linear temporal logic (with next <span class="math inline">∘</span>, eventually <span class="math inline">◇</span>, and henceforth <span class="math inline">□</span> modalities) whose propositional fragment is Gödel–Dummett logic (which is well known both as a superintuitionistic logic and a t-norm fuzzy logic). The importance of both linear temporal logic and of fuzzy logics in computer science is well established.</p>
<p>We define the logic using two natural semantics—a real-valued semantics and a semantics where truth values are captured by a linear Kripke frame—and can show that these indeed define one and the same logic. Although this Gödel temporal logic does not have any form of the finite model property for these two semantics, we are able to prove decidability of the validity problem. The proof makes use of <em>quasimodels</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="cite1"></span>, which are a variation on Kripke models where time can be nondeterministic. We can show that every falsifiable formula is falsifiable on a finite quasimodel, which yields decidability. We then strengthen this result to PSPACE-complete. Further, we provide a deductive calculus for Gödel temporal logic with a finite number of axioms and deduction rules, and can show this calculus to be sound and complete for the above-mentioned semantics.</p>
