Given any propositional language $L$
(viz., a set of connectives,
treated as operation symbols, when dealing
with $L$-algebras),
an {\em $L$-logic\/} $C$ %where $L$ is a propositional
%language, %/signature,
%constituted by {\em [propositional] connectives},
(viz., a structural %--- i.e, commuting
closure operator over the set $\Fm_L$
of $L$-formulas
with variables in %a countable set,
%of the absolutely-free $L$-algebra %$\FA_L$
%freely-generated by
%the set
$\{x_i\}_{i\in\omega}$
%of propositional variables
$\langle$natural numbers, including $0$,
are treated as sets of lesser ones,
the set of all them being denoted by $\omega\rangle$;
pairs of the form $\Gamma\vdash\varphi$, where
$\Gamma\subseteq\Fm_L\ni\varphi$,
being called {\em $L$-rules\/})
%[to be identified with $\varphi$ alone])
%that is structural --- i.e., $\img C$
%commutes with inverse
%propositional $L$-substitutions
%$\langle$viz., endomorphisms of $\FA_L\rangle$)
is said to ``{\em satisfy\/} an $L$-rule $\Gamma\vdash\varphi$''/``be
{\em [(\/\{almost\/\} pre-)maximally]\/
$\langle\neg$-para\/$\rangle$consisent\/}
$\langle$whe\-re $\neg\in L$ is unary$\rangle$'',
if ``$\varphi\in C(\Gamma)$''/``$C$ does not satisfy
$(\langle\{x_0,\neg x_0\}\cup\rangle\varnothing)\vdash x_1$ [and has no (more than $1\{+1\}$)
$\langle\neg$-para$\rangle$consistent
{\em proper\/} --- viz., distinct from $C$ --
{\em extension\/} --- viz., an $L$-logic satisfying all $L$-rules
$C$ satisfies],
an $L$-matrix defining such a logic being said to do/be so too''.
%{\em $\neg$-paraconsistent}.
Likewise, $C$ is said to be {\em weakly\/
$\land$-conjunctive/\/$\lor$-disjunctive},
where $\land/\lor$ is a binary connective of
$L$ (possibly, a {\em secondary\/} one; viz.,
an $L$-formula with {\em at most\/} two variables $x_0$ and $x_1$),
if $C(x_{0|1})\subseteq/\supseteq C(x_0(\land/\lor)x_1)$,
an $L$-matrix defining such a logic being said to be so too.
Then, a {\em theorem/model of\/} $C$ is any
``element of $C(\varnothing)$''/``$L$-matrix defining an
extension of $C$''.
Likewise, the least extension $C^R$ of $C$
satisfying an $L$-rule $R$
is said to be {\em
relatively axiomatized by\/} $R$.
Finally, two-valued $L$-matrices
%(with carrier $2$ of their underlying algebras as well as)
with single
distinguished value %($1$)
and operation $\neg$ %of their underlying algebras
permuting their unique distinguished and non-distinguished values
are said to be {\em %(canonically)\/
$\neg$-classical},
[any {\em sublogic of\/} --- viz., an $L$-logic with an extension being --- any of] their logics
being called {\em $\neg$-[sub]classical}.
Let $\mc{A}=\couple{\mathfrak{A}}{D}$ be
a $\neg$-paraconsistent $L$-matrix
%with underlying algebra $\mf{A}$
with carrier $A\triangleq(2\cup\{\e\})$ and
$(\neg^{\mf{A}}\restr2)=(2^2\setminus\Delta_2)$,
where $\Delta_S\triangleq\{\couple{s}{s}\mid s\in S\}$,
for any set $S$,
as well as %the set of distinguished values
$D\triangleq(A\setminus1)$,
$\mc{A}_\e\triangleq\couple{\mf{A}}{\{\e\}}$
and $C_{[\e]}$ the logic of $\mc{A}_{[\e]}$. %while
%$\mc{A}$ is said to be {\em regular},
%if %operations of $\mf{A}$ are monotonic w.r.t.
%$(\Delta_A\cup(\{\e\}\times2))\in\mbf{S}\mf{A}^2$,
%whereas a {\em binary discriminator of} $\mc{A}$
%is any secondary binary connective $\beta$ of $L$ %with at most two variables $x_0$ and $
%such that $\forall a\in D,\forall b\in(2\cdot a):
%\beta^\mf{A}(a,b)=(1-(a\cdot(1-b)))$.

the extension of\/ $C$ relatively axiomatized by
$R^{[+]}\triangleq(\{[x_0,\neg x_0,]x_1\}\vdash\neg x_1)$

$|$``\/$\neg$-subclassical\/ $\neg$-paraconsistent''
