In this paper we study frame definability in finitely-valued modal
logics and establish two main results via suitable translations: (1) in
finitely-valued modal logics one cannot define more classes of frames
than are already definable in classical modal logic (cf. [@tho Thm. 8]),
and (2) a large family of finitely-valued modal logics define exactly
the same classes of frames as classical modal logic (including modal
logics based on finite Heyting and MV-algebras). In this way one may
observe, for example, that the celebrated Goldblatt--Thomason theorem
applies immediately to these logics. In particular, we obtain the
central result from [@te] with a much simpler proof and answer one of
the open questions left in that paper. Moreover, the proposed
translations allow us to determine the computational complexity of a big
class of finitely-valued modal logics. Finally, we show that the first
translation we offer (from finitely-valued modal logic into two-valued
modal logic) yields a 0-1 law over models for the former (cf.
[@kapron1]) as a corollary of W. Oberschelp's generalization [@ober] of
Fagin's 0-1 law. In particular, one can show that, over Kripke models
for finitely-valued modal logics based on finite frames, for every modal
formula there is a truth-value that it takes almost surely at all
worlds.
