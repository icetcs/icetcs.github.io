<p>The class <span class="sans-serif">#P</span> is the class of functions that count the number of solutions to problems in <span class="sans-serif">NP</span>. Since very few counting problems can be exactly computed in polynomial time (e.g. counting spanning trees), the interest of the community has turned to the complexity of approximating them. The class <span class="sans-serif">#PE</span> of problems in <span class="sans-serif">#P</span> with decision version in <span class="sans-serif">P</span> is of great significance.</p>
<p>We focus on a subclass of <span class="sans-serif">#PE</span>, namely <span class="sans-serif">TotP</span>, the class of functions that count the total number of paths of NPTMs. <span class="sans-serif">TotP</span> contains all self-reducible <span class="sans-serif">#PE</span> functions and it is <em>robust</em>, in the sense that it has natural complete problems and it is closed under addition, multiplication and subtraction by one.</p>
<p>We present logical characterizations of <span class="sans-serif">TotP</span> and two other <em>robust</em> subclasses of this class, building upon two seminal works about descriptive complexity for classes of counting problems <span class="citation" data-cites="Saluja Arenas"></span>. Specifically, to capture <span class="sans-serif">TotP</span>, we use recursion on functions over second-order variables which, we believe, is of independent interest.</p>
