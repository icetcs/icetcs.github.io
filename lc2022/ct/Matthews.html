<p>Many large cardinals have definitions in terms of elementary embeddings from the set-theoretic universe into some inner model, with the guiding principle being that the closer this inner model is to the whole universe, the stronger the resulting theory. Under ZFC, the Kunen Inconsistency places a hard limit on how close these models can be to the true universe. In particular, that it is impossible to have a Reinhardt embedding, namely a non-trivial embedding of the universe into itself. One is then naturally led to the question of what theory is necessary to derive this contradiction, with the main focus having historically been the study of embeddings in ZF without the Axiom of Choice.</p>
<p>In this talk we shall take a different approach to weakening this theory which is to study Reinhardt embeddings in Zermelo set theory, that is set theory without Replacement. One can see that a natural model for such a theory is ZF plus the Wholeness Axiom and, under some reasonable extension of Zermelo, these two principles turn out to be equivalent. However, the story does not end here. We shall see that if we add the single instance of replacement asserting that the critical sequence is a set then the resulting theory is inconsistent. On the other hand, under its natural formulation, there is no reason for a Reinhardt embedding to be non-trivial on the ordinals. Namely, it is possible to have a Reinhardt embedding of Zermelo set theory which does not have a critical point.</p>
