While being stated in a purely combinatorial manner, it is closely connected to model theory (the objects of study are homogeneous structures), topological dynamics (its results are used to construct \emph{universal completion flows} of automorphism groups) and set theory (the tools used are infinitary tree Ramsey theorems such as the Milliken theorem or the Carlson--Simpson theorem, as well as Harrington's application of the method of forcing).It turns out that \emph{trees of types} are fundamental for understanding big Ramsey degrees. Given an enumeration of an ultrahomogeneous structure, the tree of $n$-types is formed by realised $n$-types over finite initial segments of the enumeration. For structures in binary languages, these trees have bounded branching, but this fails with relations of arity at least three, which makes the problems significantly more complicated.Recently, we were able to show that an unconstrained homogeneous relational structure has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if it is $\omega$-categorical (if and only if its tree of $n$-types is finitely branching for every $n$). In particular, this is the first time we were able to handle structures in infinite languages.This is joint work with Samuel Braunfeld, David Chodounsk\'y, No\'e de Rancourt, Jan Hubi\v{c}ka and Jamal Kawach.% \begin{thebibliography}{10}% \bibitem{Tent1}% {\scshape Katrin Tent, Martin Ziegler},% {\itshape On the isometry group of the {U}rysohn space},% {\bfseries\itshape Journal of the London Mathematical Society},% vol.~87 (2013), no.~1, pp.~289--303.% %%% For a Journal article by the same authors as above,% %%% i.e., authors in cite1 are the same for cite2% \bibitem{Tent2}% \bysame% {\itshape The isometry group of the bounded {U}rysohn space is simple},% {\bfseries\itshape Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society},% vol.~45 (2013), no.~5, pp.~1026--1030.% \bibitem{Konecny}% {\scshape Mat\v{e}j Kone\v{c}n\'{y}},% {\itshape Semigroup-valued metric spaces},% Master thesis, Charles University, 2019. arXiv:1810.08963.% \bibitem{Hubicka}% {\scshape Jan Hubi{\v{c}}ka, Mat{\v {e}}j Kone{\v {c}}n{\'{y}}, Jaroslav Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il},% {\itshape Semigroup-valued metric spaces: {R}amsey expansions and {E}{P}{P}{A}},% In preparation.% \bibitem{Li}% {\scshape Yibei Li},% {\itshape Simplicity of the automorphism groups of some binary homogeneous structures determined by triangle constraints},% arXiv:1806.01671.% %% INSERT YOUR BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES HERE; % %% SEE (4) BELOW FOR PROPER FORMAT.% %% EACH ENTRY MUST BEGIN WITH \bibitem{citation key}% %%% %% IF THERE ARE NO ENTRIES  % %% DELETE THE LINE ABOVE (\begin{thebibliography}{20}) % %% AND THE LINE BELOW (\end{thebibliography})% \end{thebibliography}\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}% this space adjustment is usually necessary after a bibliography\end{document}
