One of the characteristics of this sphere is supposed to be its ineffability. Any attempts to describe it force us to maim the expressive powers of the language we use. Surpsingly enough, Wittgenstein treats logic in a very similar way in Tractatus. Logic, then, can only be shown, not expressed. Or, to be more precise, logic can only show itself. Besides being ineffable, the mystical is also supposed to be fundamental, in fact much more important than what lies outside it. Therefore, logic also deserves this honourable status, according to Wittgenstein. Nevertheless, logicians today purport to be making explicit all kinds of logical laws which hold in variegated areas, which causes the unprecedented plurality of logics. On the other hand, it is not clear what the import of all this intellectual work is. Is there a lesson to be learned from Wittgenstein for the contemporary philosophy of logic? In order to access this possible lesson, we have to pay attention not only to early Wittgenstein but also to his later development where the notion of game and language game became prominent. I will show that taking seriously Wittgenstein´s motivation - which originates in his discussions with Moritz Schlick and his conception of games - to treat our linguistic activities as games, which are partly playful and unserious, shows us the limits of formal logical systems. They are language games themselves but do not understand themselves properly which causes them to be unsatisfying and turns the plurality of logics into a curse rather than into a blessing, getting us close to the positions of logical nihilists rather than to those of logical pluralists.    \begin{thebibliography}{10}\bibitem[Russell(2018)] {russell} Russell, G.
