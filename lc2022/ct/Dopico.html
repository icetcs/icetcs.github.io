<p>Despite being highly successful, Saul Kripke’s theory of truth (1975), based on the so-called fixed-point semantics, has been criticised on the basis of its incapacity to formulate the semantic status of paradoxical sentences such as the Liar. In other words, Kripke’s theory treats that and similar sentences as being neither true nor false, but the object language lacks the resources to speak about the <em>gappy</em> character of the Liar. From Burge (1979) to Field (2008), the tradition has suggested that this gappy character can be best understood as the idea that the Liar is not determinate or not determinately true. As a result, the main aim of this paper is to explore what being determinate in relation to a truth predicate could mean. We hence propose three different understandings of such notion in the form of three determinacy predicates and offer philosophical motivations for each of them. After that, we test different theories of truth against the background of those three understanding of truth-theoretic determinacy. In particular, we assess Kripke’s theory of truth, as well as Solomon Feferman’s well-known axiomatization of it (the so-called <strong>KF</strong>) (Halbach 2014), and Vann McGee’s theory of definite truth (1991). Our results suggest that there could be a trade-off between the semantic expressibility of a theory of truth, understood as its ability to capture the semantic status of the Liar, and the logical strength of the theory.</p>
