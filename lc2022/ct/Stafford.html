<p>Francez and co-authors <span class="citation" data-cites="Francez2010-fb Francez2014-md Francez2015"></span> attempt to offer a proof-theoretic semantics for natural language. They take the meaning of sentences to be functions from sets of assumptions (or hypothesis or premises) to canonical proofs of the sentence. A proof for Francez is canonical if it ends in an introduction rule. Using this it has been shown for a fragment of English that one gets the expected behaviour for the grammatical type of the words considered. Francez proposal distinguishes between the meaning of words given in terms of proof rules and the meanings of sentences given in terms of canonical proofs. But to do this a third element must be used which is the set of all proofs of a sentences and called the “sentence contribution”. This makes the semantics not compositional. It will be argued that the lack of compositionality here is a problem, as we want compositionality for learnability or effectiveness, it will be argued that Francez suggestion to use sentence contributions is unacceptable. I propose an alternative sentence meaning given by the set of proofs in normal form. A proof in normal form is one where all possible elimination rules are applied before introduction rules are. It then follows that we can give compositional meanings without using the sentence contributions. This is a small tweek but it allows for a compositional presentation. The presentation will argue that this definition of propositions is preferable to Francez’s original presentation.</p>
