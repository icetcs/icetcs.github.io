The notion of computable type is an interesting	example of this fact. A space has computable type if every effectively	compact copy of it is computable. Many spaces have this property,	such as spheres and closed manifolds \cite{cite1,cite2}.	A similar notion is defined for pairs with computable type. 		We proved recently a characterization of simplicial pairs with computable	type (see \cite{cite3}). In particular, we proved that a simplicial	cone pair has computable type iff it has the surjection property.	Namely, a simplicial pair~$(Cone(X),X)$ has computable type iff	every continuous function~$f:Cone(X)\rightarrow Cone(X)$ which is	the identity in~$X$ is a surjection.		It raises a purely topological question: when does a pair has the	surjection property? We prove connections between the surjection property	and homology: for instance, the cone of a graph has the surjection property	iff every point of its base is in a cycle. We try to generalize this	to some other simplicial pairs and we explain an open question whose	positive answer gives a full characterization of simpilicial cone	pairs which have the surjection property using the relative homology	of their base pairs.%\end{abstract}\begin{thebibliography}{10}\bibitem{cite1}{\scshape Joseph S.
