The goal of this talk is to outline a construction of hyperations for certain uniform functions on linear orders in second order arithmetic and discuss the logical strength of preservation of well-foundedness by this construction in the light of reverse mathematics. \\For the first goal, we will employ the notion of dilators introduced by Girard and show how a sufficiently uniform categorical treatment of finite iterations can be extended to transfinite exponents. Such a construction has already appeared for the standard Veblen hierarchy in \cite{GV84}.\\The proof-theoretic discussion builds on a framework developed in \cite{PW21}, relating transfinitely iterated syntactic reflection to semantic $\omega$-model reflection. The ordinal analysis of $\operatorname{ATR}_0$ developed there is relativized to an arbitrary normal dilator $T$, yielding an equivalence between the principles ``$\textit{the hyperation of }T\textit{ preserves well-foundedness}$'' and $\Pi^1_2\text{-}\omega\operatorname{RFN}(\Pi^1_1\text{-}\operatorname{BI}_0+~T\textit{ is a dilator})$ over the weak base theory $\operatorname{RCA}_0$.\\The master thesis on which this talk is based has been supervised by Andreas Weiermann and Fedor Pakhomov from the Logic group at Ghent University. \begin{thebibliography}{10}%% INSERT YOUR BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES HERE; %% SEE (4) BELOW FOR PROPER FORMAT.%% EACH ENTRY MUST BEGIN WITH \bibitem{citation key}%%%% IF THERE ARE NO ENTRIES  %% DELETE THE LINE ABOVE (\begin{thebibliography}{20}) %% AND THE LINE BELOW (\end{thebibliography})\bibitem{FJ13}{\scshape David Fern\'{a}ndez{-}Duque and Joost J.
