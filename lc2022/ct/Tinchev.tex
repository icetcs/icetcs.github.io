Denote by $\mathcal{K}^{\rm fin}$ and by  $\mathcal{K}^{\leq\omega}$ the classes of frames from  $\mathcal{K}^{\rm fin}$ having finetely many, resp. at most countably many, clusters.  Our goal is to study the modal definability problem on these three classes.  Remind that a sentence $A$ from the first-order language with equality and one binary predicate symbol is modally definable with respect to some class of frames if there is a modal formula $\varphi$ from the classical propositional modal language  such that $A$ and $\varphi$ are valid in the same frames from the class. Modal definability problem ask whether there exists an algorithm that recognizes modally definable sentences.  In this talk we make a heavy use of decidability of Rabins's $S2S$ theory to prove the following.\begin{theorem}The modal definability problem is decidable with respect to the classes $\mathcal{K}^{\rm fin}$ and $\mathcal{K}^{\leq\omega}$. \end{theorem}\begin{theorem}For any  sentence $A$, $A$ is modally definable with respect to $\mathcal{K}$ if and only if $A$ is modally definable with respect to $\mathcal{K}^{\leq\omega}$. Therefore, the modal definability problem with respect to $\mathcal{K}$  is decidable.\end{theorem} \begin{theorem}\begin{enumerate} 1. There is an algorithm which for any sentence $A$ gives a modal definition of $A$ on $\mathcal{K}^{\rm fin}$, if such modal formula exists.2. There is an algorithm which for any sentence $A$ gives a modal definition of $A$ on $\mathcal{K}$, if such modal formula exists.\end{enumerate}\end{theorem}%\begin{thebibliography}{10}%% INSERT YOUR BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES HERE; %% SEE (4) BELOW FOR PROPER FORMAT.%% EACH ENTRY MUST BEGIN WITH \bibitem{citation key}%%%% IF THERE ARE NO ENTRIES  %% DELETE THE LINE ABOVE (\begin{thebibliography}{20}) %% AND THE LINE BELOW (\end{thebibliography})%\end{thebibliography}%\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}% this space adjustment is usually necessary after a bibliography\end{document}%% READ ME%% READ ME%% READ MEINSTRUCTIONS FOR SUPPLYING INFORMATION IN THE CORRECT FORMAT: 1.
