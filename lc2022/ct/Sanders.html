<p>I provide an overview of recent joint work with Dag Normann on the computability theory of ordinary mathematics (<span class="citation" data-cites="dagsamXII dagsamXIII"></span>), as follows.</p>
<p>Given a finite set, perhaps the most basic questions are <em>how many</em> elements it has, and <em>which ones</em>? We study this question in Kleene’s <em>higher-order computability theory</em>, based on his computation schemes S1-S9 (<span class="citation" data-cites="longmann"></span>). In particular, a central object of study is the higher-order functional <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> which on input a finite set of real numbers, list the elements as a finite sequence.</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the ‘finiteness’ functional <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> give rise to a <em>huge and robust</em> class of computationally equivalent operations, called the <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span>-cluster. For instance, many basic operations on functions of <em>bounded variation</em> (<span class="math inline"><em>B</em><em>V</em></span>) are part of the <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span>-cluster, including those stemming from the well-known <em>Jordan decomposition theorem</em>. In addition, we identify a second cluster of computationally equivalent objects, called the <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span>-cluster, based on the functional <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span>, the restriction of <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> to singletons. We also show that both clusters include basic operations on <em>regulated</em> and <em>Sobolev space</em> functions, respectively a well-known super- and sub-class of the class of <span class="math inline"><em>B</em><em>V</em></span>-functions.</p>
<p>Our objects of study are fundamentally <em>partial</em> in nature, and we formulate an elegant and equivalent <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>-calculus formulation of S1-S9 to accommodate partial objects. The advantages of this approach are three-fold: proofs are more transparent in our <span class="math inline"><em>λ</em></span>-calculus approach, all (previously hand-waved) technical details can be settled easily, and we can show that <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em><sub>1</sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>Ω</em></span> are not computationally equivalent to any <em>total</em> functional.</p>
