%% INSERT TEXT OF ABSTRACT DIRECTLY BELOW

(joint with A. Karagila) Forcing is ubiquitous in set theory but a lot of its general theory depends on the Axiom of Choice (AC). Nevertheless, forcing still serves as the main technique for extending models of ZF, with or without AC. We will present results about forcing when AC fails, particularily in relation to Dependent Choice (DC) and its preservation.
