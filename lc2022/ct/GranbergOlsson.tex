The starting point is the result of Cantini \cite{Cantini:1989} and Feferman \cite{Feferman:1991} (extended to the transfinite by Fujimoto \cite{Fujimoto:2011}) that the (classical) theory of positive fixpoints $\widehat{\mathrm{ID}}_1$, the Kripke-Feferman compositional theory of partial truth $\mathrm{KF}$, and the uniformly disquotational theory for truth-positive formulae $\mathrm{PUTB}$ are mutually interpretable. We obtain similar results for the theories of transfinite iterations of strictly positive fixpoints (as in \cite{Ruede_Strahm:2002}) for almost negative operators, and disquotation for almost negative strictly truth-positive sentences, in intuitionistic logic (which we call $\widehat{\mathrm{ID}}_{\alpha}^{\mathrm{i}}(\Lambda)$ and $\mathrm{P \Lambda UTB}_{\alpha}^{\mathrm{i}}$ respectively):\begin{itemize}\item First, $\widehat{\mathrm{ID}}_{\alpha}^{\mathrm{i}}(\Lambda)$ is interpretable in $\mathrm{P \Lambda UTB}_{\alpha}^{\mathrm{i}}$ by mimicking the classical proof.\item Second, $\mathrm{P \Lambda UTB}_{\alpha}^{\mathrm{i}}$ is interpretable (via a compositional theory) in $\widehat{\mathrm{ID}}_{\omega \cdot \alpha}^{\mathrm{i}}$ for limit $\alpha$. This is achieved by using the extra `spacing' between the levels, given by the multiplication by $\omega$, to keep track of the nestings of implications in formulae.\end{itemize}\begin{thebibliography}{10}%% INSERT YOUR BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES HERE; %% SEE (4) BELOW FOR PROPER FORMAT.%% EACH ENTRY MUST BEGIN WITH \bibitem{citation key}%%%% IF THERE ARE NO ENTRIES  %% DELETE THE LINE ABOVE (\begin{thebibliography}{20}) %% AND THE LINE BELOW (\end{thebibliography})\bibitem{Cantini:1989}{\scshape Andrea Cantini},{\itshape Notes on formal theories of truth},{\bfseries\itshape Zeitschrift f{\"u}r Mathematiscche Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik},vol.~35 (1989), no.~2, pp.~97--130.\bibitem{Feferman:1991}{\scshape Solomon Feferman},{\itshape Reflecting on incompleteness},{\bfseries\itshape The Journal of Symbolic Logic},vol.~56 (1991), no.~1, pp.~1--49.\bibitem{Fujimoto:2011}{\scshape Kentaro Fujimoto},{\itshape Autonomous progression and transfinite iteration of self-applicable truth},{\bfseries\itshape The Journal of Symbolic Logic},vol.~76 (2011), no.~3, pp.~914--945.\bibitem{Ruede_Strahm:2002}{\scshape Christian R{\"u}ede and Thomas Strahm},{\itshape Intuitionistic fixed point theories for strictly positive operators},{\bfseries\itshape Mathematical Logic Quaterly},vol.~48 (2002), no.~2, pp.~195--202.\end{thebibliography}\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}% this space adjustment is usually necessary after a bibliography\end{document}%% READ ME%% READ ME%% READ MEINSTRUCTIONS FOR SUPPLYING INFORMATION IN THE CORRECT FORMAT: 1.
