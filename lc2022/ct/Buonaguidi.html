<p>The notion of hyperintensionality and has become of prime importance in contemporary research, to the point that Nolan <span class="citation" data-cites="Nolan2014-NOLHM"></span> predicted a “hyperintensional revolution" for the 21st century. In a recent paper, Odintsov and Wansing <span class="citation" data-cites="Odintsov2021-ODIRSA"></span> criticize the claim to hyperintensionality of Leitgeb’s logic HYPE <span class="citation" data-cites="Leitgeb2019-LEIHAS"></span>, and suggest a definition of hyperintensionality based on a logic’s consequence relation <span class="citation" data-cites="Odintsov2021-ODIRSA"></span>. According to this criterion, HYPE is not hyperintensional, but merely intensional. However, the picture is not as clear-cut as it seems. Indeed, we can distinguish three notions of hyperintensionality, corresponding to different informal definitions in the hyperintensional metaphysics literature: Odintsov and Wansing only formulate one of these criteria. However, HYPE can be assessed also with respect to the other two. I show it to be hyperintensional with respect to the last, and weakest, criterion. We cannot therefore say that HYPE is hyperintensional proper, but we can say that it is strongly intensional, and not just intensional. In fact, it is precisely the fact that HYPE is strongly intensional and not merely intensional allows to successfully model hyperintensional operators in HYPE-models. This shows that, although HYPE’s consequence relation is well-behaved enough to make it stronger than most non-classical logics, HYPE’s semantics is especially powerful.</p>
<p>I note another result showing this feature. Leitgeb argued that HYPE has the disjunction property <span class="citation" data-cites="Leitgeb2019-LEIHAS"></span>. However, as noted by Odintsov and Wansing <span class="citation" data-cites="Odintsov2021-ODIRSA"></span>, HYPE can be shown to be equivalent to the logic <span class="math inline"><em>N</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><sup>*</sup></span>, which has been shown not to have the disjunction property <span class="citation" data-cites="Drobyshevich2015"></span>. I show that HYPE does not have the disjunction property at the level of its consequence relation, but that the disjunction property holds in all HYPE-models.</p>
