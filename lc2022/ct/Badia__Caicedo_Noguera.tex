%% INSERT TEXT OF ABSTRACT DIRECTLY BELOW

In this paper we study frame definability in finitely-valued modal logics and establish two main results via suitable translations: (1) in finitely-valued modal logics one cannot define more classes of frames than are already definable in classical modal logic (cf.~\cite[Thm.~8]{tho}), and (2)  a large family of finitely-valued modal logics define exactly the same classes of frames as classical modal logic (including modal logics based on finite Heyting and MV-algebras). In this way one may observe, for example, that the celebrated Goldblatt--Thomason theorem applies immediately to these logics. In particular, we obtain the central result from~\cite{te} with a much simpler proof  and answer one of the open questions left in that paper. Moreover, the proposed translations allow us to determine the computational complexity of a big class of finitely-valued modal logics. Finally, we show that the first translation we offer  (from finitely-valued modal logic into two-valued modal logic) yields a  0-1 law over models for the former (cf. \cite{kapron1}) as a corollary of W. Oberschelp's generalization \cite{ober} of  Fagin's 0-1 law. In particular, one can show that, over Kripke models for finitely-valued modal logics based on finite frames, for every modal formula  there is a truth-value that it takes almost surely at all worlds.
