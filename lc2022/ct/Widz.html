<p>Given a family of real functions <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> we say that a set <span class="math inline"><em>M</em> ⊂ ℝ</span> is magic for <span class="math inline"><em>F</em></span> if for all <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>, <em>g</em> ∈ <em>F</em></span> we have <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>[<em>M</em>] ⊂ <em>g</em>[<em>M</em>] ⟹ <em>f</em> = <em>g</em></span>. This notion was introduced by Diamond, Pomerance and Rubel in 1981 [1] and investigated by many mathematicians, including S. Shelah, K. Ciesielski and M. Burke. Recently some results about magic sets were proved by Halbeisen, Lischka and Schumacher [2]. Inspired by their work I constructed two families of magic sets one of them being almost disjoint and the other one being independent. During my talk I will sketch the background, present the construction of one of those families, and show some general properties of magic sets.</p>
