Such sequences always reach zero, but this fact is unprovable in Peano arithmetic. \\In this talk, we will consider canonical representations of natural numbers using Ackermann function and the function of Grzegorczyk hierarchy. These representations give a natural Goodstein process for which we obtain independence from different theories of reverse mathematics. \\This is a joint ongoing work with A. Weiermann and D. Fern\'andez-Duque on exploring normal form notations for the Goodstein principle.\begin{thebibliography}{10}\bibitem{cite1}{\scshape  D.Fern\'andez-Duque, O.Gjetaj, A.
