Since any first-order axiomatizable theory is recursively enumerable and it is known in the theory of computability that K is the hardest recursively enumerable set in terms of Turing reduction, it is immediately an interesting question whether each of those undecidable first-order axiomatizable mereological theories is as hard as K, or in other words, is Turing equivalent to K. Since any 1-complete set must be Turing equivalent to K, we will give a positive answer to the said question by showing that each of those undecidable first-order axiomatizable mereological theories is 1-complete.\begin{thebibliography}{10}%% INSERT YOUR BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES HERE; %% SEE (4) BELOW FOR PROPER FORMAT.%% EACH ENTRY MUST BEGIN WITH \bibitem{citation key}%%%% IF THERE ARE NO ENTRIES  %% DELETE THE LINE ABOVE (\begin{thebibliography}{20}) %% AND THE LINE BELOW (\end{thebibliography})\bibitem{cite1}{\scshape Hsing-Chien Tsai},{\itshape A Comprehensive Picture of the Decidability of Mereological Theories},{\bfseries\itshape Studia Logica},vol.~101 (2013), no.~5, pp.~987-1012.\end{thebibliography}\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}% this space adjustment is usually necessary after a bibliography\end{document}%% READ ME%% READ ME%% READ MEINSTRUCTIONS FOR SUPPLYING INFORMATION IN THE CORRECT FORMAT: 1.
