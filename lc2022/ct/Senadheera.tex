%% INSERT TEXT OF ABSTRACT DIRECTLY BELOW

The Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning model is a machine learning model introduced by Leslie Valiant in 1984. Similar to Turing reducibility there is a reducibility to this learning model as well. The PACi means a less restricted version of PAC reducibility. Here \textit{i} refers to the independence of the size and the computation time of the PAC reducibility.  
The ordering of concept classes under PAC reducibility is nonlinear, even when restricted to particular concrete examples. We recursively construct two c.e. effective concept classes of incomparable PACi degrees to show that there exist incomparable PACi degrees. Similarly, we can construct for PAC degrees which is analogous to incomparable Turing degrees. The priority construction method is used to construct the two concept classes, which was used by Friedburg and Muchnik in their proof of incomparable Turing degrees.  It was necessary to deal with the size of an effective concept class thus we propose to compute the size of the effective concept class using Kolmogorov complexity. Furthermore, we explore the jump structure of effective concept classes similar to the Turing jump and progress toward embedding $1$degrees.
