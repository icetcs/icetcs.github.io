%% INSERT TEXT OF ABSTRACT DIRECTLY BELOW

The aim of the talk is to discuss differences between formal and philosophical interpretations of propositional identity across classical and intuitionistic logic. In classical logic propositional identity is closely related to the abolition of the Fregean Axiom \cite{suszko1975}, according to which sentences are names of truth values. In reference to the ideas from Wittgenstein's  \emph{Tractatus} we may, contrary to Frege, assume that propositions denote situations. In such case, due to Quine \emph{dictum}, we need to introduce criteria of identity of situations, as it was done for example by Suszko \cite{suszko1968}. This picture changes when we move to the constructive environment. Here, propositions can be thought of as types of their own proofs and propositional identity can be interpreted as expressing the notion of identity of proofs \cite{isci}.
