While $\mathsf{VF}$ is satisfied in every model $\langle \mathbb{N}, X \rangle$ such that $\Phi_{SV}(X) = X$, the converse direction ($\mathbb{N} \mhyph categoricity$~\cite{cite2}) does not hold, that is, $\mathsf{VF}$ fails to completely characterise the fixed points of $\Phi_{SV}$.Moreover, some authors have criticised $\mathsf{VF}$ because the axioms of $\mathsf{VF}$ do not mirror the structure of $\Phi_{SV}$ and thus these axioms seem somewhat unrelated. Even worse, Fischer et al.~\cite{cite2} showed that no recursively enumerable first-order theory can satisfy the $\mathbb{N}$-categoricity for $\Phi_{SV}.$Therefore, to give a supervaluation-style axiomatisation that properly mirrors the intended operator, we also need to change $\Phi_{SV}$ itself without losing its supervaluational character.In this talk, we give another operator $\Phi_{SV'},$ which results from replacing the set-theoretic notions used in $\Phi_{SV}$ by purely semantic talk (cf.~\cite{cite3} ). With the help of an additional typed truth predicate, an axiomatisation $\mathsf{VF}'$ for $\Phi_{SV'}$ is naturally induced; we show that $\mathsf{VF}'$ contains $\mathsf{VF}$ and satisfies the $\mathbb{N}$-categoricity-like result for $\Phi_{SV'}.$ If time permits, we also prove that $\mathsf{VF}'$ has the same proof-theoretic strength as $\Pi_{1}^{1} \mhyph \mathsf{CA}^{\mhyph}$.This work was partially supported by JSPS KAKENHI, Grant Number 20J12361.\begin{thebibliography}{10}%% INSERT YOUR BIBLIOGRAPHIC ENTRIES HERE; %% SEE (4) BELOW FOR PROPER FORMAT.%% EACH ENTRY MUST BEGIN WITH \bibitem{citation key}%%%% IF THERE ARE NO ENTRIES  %% DELETE THE LINE ABOVE (\begin{thebibliography}{20}) %% AND THE LINE BELOW (\end{thebibliography})\bibitem{cite1}{\scshape Cantini Andrea},{\itshape A theory of formal truth arithmetically equivalent to ID1},{\bfseries\itshape The Journal of Symbolic Logic},vol.~55 (1990), no.~1, pp.~244--259.\bibitem{cite2}{\scshape Fischer Martin, Halbach Volker, Kriener J{\"o}nne, and Stern Johannes},{\itshape Axiomatizing semantic theories of truth?},{\bfseries\itshape The Review of Symbolic Logic},vol.~8 (2015), no.~2, pp.~257--278.\bibitem{cite3}{\scshape Halbach Volker},{\itshape Truth and reduction},{\bfseries\itshape Erkenntnis},vol.~53 (2000), no.~1, pp.~97--126.\bibitem{cite4}{\scshape Kripke Saul},{\itshape Outline of a theory of truth},{\bfseries\itshape The journal of philosophy},vol.~72 (1976), no.~19, pp.~690--716.\end{thebibliography}\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}% this space adjustment is usually necessary after a bibliography\end{document}%% READ ME%% READ ME%% READ MEINSTRUCTIONS FOR SUPPLYING INFORMATION IN THE CORRECT FORMAT: 1.
