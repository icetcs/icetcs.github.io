<p>It is widely believed that Gödel’s first and second incompleteness theorem (<span>G1</span> and <span>G2</span>) undermined Hilbert’s program. We examine the relevance of <span>G1</span> and <span>G2</span> with Hilbert’s concrete proof theory. We argue that even if <span>G1</span> and <span>G2</span> refute (in a narrow sense) some original goals of Hilbert’s program, Gödel’s solutions are not concrete and real in the sense of Hilbert’s concrete proof theory.</p>
<p>We could view <span>G1</span> as an existence problem. In the sense of Hilbert’s concrete proof theory, the independent sentence of <span>PA</span> Gödel constructed is an ideal element which is not real and concrete. Even if we can say (in the narrow sense) that <span>G1</span> shows there is no strong enough consistent axiomatized formal system in which all true statements are provable, <span>G1</span> does not answer the following question in the spirit of Hilbert’s concrete proof theory: whether all concrete true arithmetic sentences are provable in <span>PA</span>. The research program after Gödel on concrete incompleteness looks for concrete and real solutions of the existence problem of <span>G1</span>. We could view this research practice as a realization of Hilbert’s concrete proof theory.</p>
<p>It is a popular view that <span>G2</span> destroys Hilbert’s consistency program. Nonetheless, there are dissidents (see <span class="citation" data-cites="Detlefsen"></span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Artemov"></span>). Neither Gödel nor Hilbert think Hilbert’s consistency program were destroyed by <span>G2</span>. Hilbert thinks <span>G2</span> only shows one must exploit the finitary standpoint in a sharper way for the consistency proofs (see <span class="citation" data-cites="Hilbert"></span>). Gödel writes in <span class="citation" data-cites="Godel"></span> that it is conceivable that there exist finitary proofs that can not be expressed in the formalism of the basis system. We argue that the current research on the consistency problem confirms Gödel’s view that <span>G2</span> does not destroy but leaves Hilbert’s program very much alive and even more interesting than it initially was. There is no purely mathematical solution of the consistency problem since each solution of it is related to a philosophical question: what is a solution of the consistency problem? A key issue of this problem is: how to formulate the consistency statement and what is the “correct" formulation if any? Different formulations of the consistency statement may lead to different answers of the consistency problem. We examine different methods to formulate the consistency statement and compare them in the spirit of Hilbert’s concrete proof theory: whether one formulation of the consistency statement is more concrete than another one. This research is a beginning step toward the interesting open question: what is a “natural" consistency statement?</p>
<p>In summary, in a strong sense we argue that Gödel’s original <span>G1</span> and <span>G2</span> have no relevance with Hilbert’s concrete proof theory; but some lines of research after Gödel on <span>G1</span> and <span>G2</span> can be interpreted as a realization of Hilbert’s concrete proof theory in the sense of finding concrete solutions of the existence problem in <span>G1</span> and formulating the consistency statement in a more natural and concrete way.</p>
